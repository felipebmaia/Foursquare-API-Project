# Foursquare-API-Project

This project aimed to identify the best place to open a vegan restaurant in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For this, the API Foursquare Geolocation was used. With these data, a k-means clustering model was generated to identify the profile of each region and assist in the decision making of the ideal place.
